<h3> Data Structures and Algorithms </h3>

This repository will contain my work for Algorithmic Toolbox class for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization</a> that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in Python3.

<h3> About This course </h3>

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

* Disclaimer: It violates Coursera's Honor Code if you copy my answer directly for your assignment. It doesn't help learning and it's not useful at all. I don't think reading one of the solutions before trying to solve the problem is a good way to learn either. I actually learned something by doing some research online to get some hints or strategies for solving the problems. Useful resources will be posted in the readme files for each folders.
